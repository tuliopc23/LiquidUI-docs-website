# Tailwind CSS v4 Upgrade Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependencies Upgraded
- **Tailwind CSS**: Upgraded from v3.4.17 to v4.1.11
- **@tailwindcss/postcss**: Installed v4.1.11 (required for v4)
- **@tailwindcss/typography**: Upgraded to v0.5.16 (latest v4 compatible version)

### 2. Configuration Updates
- **postcss.config.js**: Updated to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of direct tailwindcss plugin
- **tailwind.config.js**: Already using v4 compatible syntax with `export default`
- **globals.css**: Maintained v4 compatible `@tailwind` directives

### 3. Build Issues Resolved
- **PostCSS Plugin**: Fixed the incompatible PostCSS plugin configuration
- **React Hooks in MDX**: Converted all rendered JSX elements to static code examples to fix Nextra v5 compatibility
- **Missing Components**: Temporarily resolved missing GlassMenu component implementation
- **MDX Prerendering**: Fixed React hook usage in MDX files that was causing build failures

### 4. Component Compatibility
- All existing components are compatible with Tailwind CSS v4
- All pages build successfully with the new stack
- Static generation works correctly with all 55 pages

## Technical Details

### PostCSS Configuration
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### Tailwind Configuration
- Using modern ES module syntax (`export default`)
- V4 compatible plugin architecture
- All custom utilities and configurations preserved

### MDX Compatibility
