# Test Nextra 4.3 Equivalent Features :rocket:

This page demonstrates the Nextra 4.3-equivalent features that have been implemented:

## Enhanced FlexSearch
Try searching for content using the search bar above. The search is now enhanced with:

- :fire: Fire emoji
- :tada: Party emoji
- :bulb: Light bulb emoji

## Enhanced Security Headers
This site now includes comprehensive security headers (equivalent to nextra/headers):
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer info
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to browser features

## Custom Favicon Glyph :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:
Check the browser tab - you should see a ðŸ’§ (water drop) emoji as the favicon using the `faviconGlyph` configuration!

## Enhanced Code Blocks
```javascript
// Enhanced code blocks with improved styling
const greeting = "Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹";
const features = [
  'FlexSearch',
  'Emoji Support',
  'Security Headers',
  'Custom Favicon',
  'Enhanced UX'
];

console.log(greeting);
features.forEach(feature => {
  console.log(`âœ… ${feature} implemented!`);
});
```

## Enhanced MDX Components
Custom MDX components provide:
- **Emoji processing** in all text elements
- **Enhanced images** with lazy loading and rounded corners
- **Improved code styling** with better contrast
- **Beautiful blockquotes** with colored borders

> This is an enhanced blockquote with custom styling! :bulb:

## Reading Time Estimation

## LaTeX Support
Math expressions are fully supported:

$$E = mc^2$$

## Copy Code Button
All code blocks now have a default copy button enabled! :gear:
